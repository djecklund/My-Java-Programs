# My-Java-Programs
This repository contains the Java Programs I've built

<b>Programs in this repository:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>JavaCalculator</b> - Multi-use calculator created in NetBeans IDE</li>
<li><b>EmployeeCostCalculator</b> - Calculation of employee costs, Created in NetBeans as a Maven Project.</li>
<li><b>HowFastCanYouType</b> - This program calculates the amount of time it takes for the user to type an idiom into a textfield. The idiom is randomly generated when the user clicks a start button. The program was originally a homework assignment from my school. I decided to recreate it with an added feature. The new feature is the program writing the user's info (idiom and time it took to write it) into an excel spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>

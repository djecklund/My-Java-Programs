# My-Java-Programs
This repository contains the Java Programs I've built

<b>Programs in this repository:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>JavaCalculator</b> - Multi-use calculator created in NetBeans IDE</li>
<li><b>EmployeeCostCalculator</b> - Calculation of employee costs, Created in NetBeans as a Maven Project.</li>
<li><b>HowFastCanYouType</b> - This program calculates the amount of time it takes for the user to type an idiom into a textfield. The idiom is randomly generated when the user clicks a start button. The program was originally a homework assignment from my school. I decided to recreate it with an added feature. The new feature is the program writing the user's info (idiom and time it took to write it) into an excel spreadsheet.</li>
<li><b>GPACalculator</b> - This program takes in class information from an excel spreadsheet. (Class Info.xls in the Grades folder) The program collects that data into an ArrayList then uses functions to calculate the GPA of the classes. The program also allows for the user to add new classes or modify/remove an existing class. When the user adds, modifies, or removes a class, the excel spreadsheet is updated accordingly. The user also has an option to query specific classes by subject. (IFSC, MATH, ect...) <b>Newest update: User can now export Class information to a couple file formats. (xlsx, xls, csv, tsv, pip)</b><br>
  <li><b>VABenefits</b> - Calculates the benefits an individual gets from the VA.</li>
  <li><b>CustomLinkedList</b> - I developed my own custom LinkedList. This was an experiment I wanted to try. It has the functionality to add nodes to the tail of the LinkedList or add a node at a specific index. I have also added functionality to find a node that contains a specific piece of data. I am currently working on adding deletion as a functionality. I want to be able to delete nodes based on if it is at a specific index or contains certain data. I have added a Linked List for some of the datatypes. I plan to add functionality to allow for more datatypes at a future time.</li>
  <li><b>HierarchyExample</b> - This program is a basic example of how to work with abstract classes as well as interfaces. In the HierarchyExample folder there is a picture that gives a visual representation of what the hierarchy looks like.</li>
  <li><b>Who wants to be a Millionaire</b> - This is my version of the famous game "Who wants to be a millionaire".</li>
  <li><b>Othello</b> - This is my version of the game "Othello". I worked on this a while back. It's not very well made, but is still a cool game.</li>
  <li><b>MySQLJavaExample</b> - This program takes data from a MySQL database that I created and displays the data. The database was originally created as a school project. I wanted to challenge myself by creating somwthing different from what I'm used to creating. This program allowed me to mix my knowledge of Java and SQL into one program.<br>
    <b>Future updates: </b>I would like to add functionality for the user to add/remove/update data on any of the tables. I would also like to do more research into giving the user the ability to create their own custom queries. (The user may want to look up information on a single patient or employee)</li>

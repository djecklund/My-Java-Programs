# My-Java-Programs
This repository contains the Java Programs I've built

<b>Programs in this repository:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>JavaCalculator</b> - Multi-use calculator created in NetBeans IDE</li>
<li><b>EmployeeCostCalculator</b> - Calculation of employee costs, Created in NetBeans as a Maven Project.</li>
<li><b>HowFastCanYouType</b> - This program calculates the amount of time it takes for the user to type an idiom into a textfield. The idiom is randomly generated when the user clicks a start button. The program was originally a homework assignment from my school. I decided to recreate it with an added feature. The new feature is the program writing the user's info (idiom and time it took to write it) into an excel spreadsheet.</li>
<li><b>GPACalculator</b> - This program takes in class information from an excel spreadsheet. (Class Info.xls in the Grades folder) The program collects that data into an ArrayList then uses functions to calculate the GPA of the classes. The program also allows for the user to add new classes or remove an existing class. When the user adds or removes a class, the excel spreadsheet is updated accordingly.<br>
<b>Future Updates:</b> I will be adding a feature where the user can search through the classes and calculate GPA of very specific classes. (EX: IFSC abbreviated classes)</li>
</ol>

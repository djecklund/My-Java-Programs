# My-Java-Programs
This repository contains the Java Programs I've built

<b>Programs in this repository:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>JavaCalculator</b> - Multi-use calculator created in NetBeans IDE</li>
<li><b>EmployeeCostCalculator</b> - Calculation of employee costs, Created in NetBeans as a Maven Project.</li>
<li><b>HowFastCanYouType</b> - This program calculates the amount of time it takes for the user to type an idiom into a textfield. The idiom is randomly generated when the user clicks a start button. The program was originally a homework assignment from my school. I decided to recreate it with an added feature. The new feature is the program writing the user's info (idiom and time it took to write it) into an excel spreadsheet.</li>
<li><b>GPACalculator</b> - This program takes in class information from an excel spreadsheet. (Class Info.xls in the Grades folder) The program collects that data into an ArrayList then uses functions to calculate the GPA of the classes. The program also allows for the user to add new classes or modify/remove an existing class. When the user adds, modifies, or removes a class, the excel spreadsheet is updated accordingly. The user also has an option to query specific classes by subject. (IFSC, MATH, ect...)<br>
  <li><b>VABenefits</b> - Calculates the benefits an individual gets from the VA.</li>
  <li><b>CustomLinkedList:</b> - I developed my own custom LinkedList. This was an experiment I wanted to try. It has the functionality to add nodes to the tail of the LinkedList or add a node at a specific index. I have also added functionality to find a node that contains a specific piece of data. I am currently working on adding deletion as a functionality. I want to be able to delete nodes based on if it is at a specific index or contains certain data. The LinkedList is currently only set up to work with String data. I plan to add functionality to allow for more datatypes at a future time.</li>
</ol>
